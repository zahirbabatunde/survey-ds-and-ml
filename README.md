# Kaggle Machine Learning and Data Science Survey
This project explores the `2020 Kaggle Machine Learning (ML) & Data Science (DS) Survey` dataset to understand the nature of women's representation in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) industry. It also gives an insight into how different levels of formal education affects annual income.
Workdone in the project:
 - Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset to summarize the main characteristics.
 - Bootstraping and performing a two-sample t-test to estimate difference between average salary of men and women.
 - Performing an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the means of salary for three level of formal education (Bachelor's, Master's and Doctoral degree).
